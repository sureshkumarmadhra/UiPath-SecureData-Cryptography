# UiPath-SecureData-Cryptography
-----------------------------------------

This package enables users to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data by using state of the art encryption protocols.

Introduction:
-------------

The UiPath Cryptography Activities package help to secure the sensitive data in enterprise project. 
The Activity package has two ways of protecting the data 

Data - Text and File

Security Options:
-----------------

1. Hash Algorithim:

This package enables users to apply HashKey Algorithm using following technique [MD5, RIPEMD160, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512]

2. Encryption Algorithim : 

This package enables users to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data by using encryption protocols [AES, DES, RC2, Rijndael, and TripleDES]

Source Code:

Cryptography.xmal file contains the source code to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data by using encryption protocols [AES, DES, RC2, Rijndael, and TripleDES]

Attached 2 Folder:

decrypted - Contains text file for encryption
encrypted - Contains text file post decryption
